# 🪄 TryingToMakeAymenComfortable  
### Because making a professor comfortable requires… automation, coffee, and questionable sanity

## 📌 About the Project  
**TryingToMakeAymenComfortable** is a heroic attempt by Saeed (a.k.a. the last surviving student with hope) to automate marking students absent, because:

- Clicking 80+ checkboxes manually is a crime  
- Ayman is tired  
- Saeed is tired  
- The university portal was built before the invention of happiness  
- And comfort is important for professor performance™

This project uses a **Tampermonkey automation script** that adds a shiny red button:

> **“Mark All Absent”**

Because nothing says *comfort* like mass-absence with one glorious tap.

- ✔️ Works with the system’s original absence logic  
- ✔️ Clean UI button 
- ✔️ Zero effort needed after setup  
- ✔️ Less wrist pain, more professor comfort  
- ❌ Does not fix the university system’s personality issues

## 🧠 How It Works
The script:

1. Finds all checkboxes with an ID ending in `:studentAbsence`  
2. Clicks each one politely  
3. Lets the portal do its magic  
4. Pops up a message like:  
   > “Done! Marked 47 students absent. dr Ayman is now 3% more comfortable.”
